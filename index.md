# Workshop on Quantitative Physics Education Research 2020

The present workshop aims at gathering people from the cross cutting fields of physics education research (PER), statistics, computational social science, and educational data mining to come together for three days to discuss the current and future state of quantitative PER. Organized under three overarching topics of of data sources, statistical methods, and visualization tools this workshop has the ambitious goal of:

- Identify new research directions in PER that can be answered via quantitative analysis
- Identify new developments in machine learning and statistics communities that can directly address open research questions in PER
- Identify currently existing data sources that can be exploited with new methods such as machine learning and text mining
- Identify missing data that can be collected via surveys, institutional data, etc. for research exploitation
- Identifying the core skills and practices of quantitative research in PER to motivate a 2021 summer school for grad students and postdocs
- Connecting cross cutting research interests between the communities of machine learning, computational social science, and PER

This workshop will give participants the opportunity to participate in working groups discussing the three overarching topics, see plenary talks from established scientists across social science, and participate as invited speakers presenting their own work. Participants will also have the chance to participate in community building activities and experience the city of Boulder, Colorado.

This workshop will be hosted at [JILA](https://jila.colorado.edu/about/about-jila), a joint institute between the University of Colorado, Boulder and NIST.
