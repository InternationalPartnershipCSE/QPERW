        <h2>Welcome to the website for the workshop on Quantitative Physics Education Research.</h2>
	<p>
	  The present workshop aims at gathering people from the cross cutting fields of physics education research (PER), statistics, computational social science, and educational data mining to come together for three days to discuss the current and future state of quantitative PER.
	  This workshop will give participants the opportunity to participate in working groups discussing the three overarching topics, see plenary talks from established scientists across social science, and participate as invited speakers presenting their own work. Participants will also have the chance to participate in community building activities and experience the city of Boulder, Colorado.

This workshop will be hosted at JILA, a joint institute between the University of Colorado, Boulder and NIST.
