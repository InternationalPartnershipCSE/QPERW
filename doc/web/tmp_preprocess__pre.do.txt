TITLE: Workshop on Quantitative Physics Education Research 
AUTHOR: "University of Colorado, Boulder":"https://www.colorado.edu/" and "JILA":"https://jila.colorado.edu/about/about-jila". June 8-10, 2020


Welcome to the website for the workshop on Quantitative Physics Education Research. 

===== Introduction =====

The present workshop aims at gathering people from the cross cutting
fields of physics education research (PER), statistics, computational
social science, and educational data mining to come together for three
days to discuss the current and future state of quantitative
PER. Organized under three overarching topics of of data sources,
statistical methods, and visualization tools this workshop has the
ambitious goal of:

o Identify new research directions in PER that can be answered via quantitative analysis
o Identify new developments in machine learning and statistics communities that can directly address open research questions in PER
o Identify currently existing data sources that can be exploited with new methods such as machine learning and text mining
o Identify missing data that can be collected via surveys, institutional data, etc. for research exploitation
o Identifying the core skills and practices of quantitative research in PER to motivate a 2021 summer school for grad students and postdocs
o Connecting cross cutting research interests between the communities of machine learning, computational social science, and PER


This workshop will give participants the opportunity to participate in
working groups discussing the three overarching topics, see plenary
talks from established scientists across social science, and
participate as invited speakers presenting their own
work. Participants will also have the chance to participate in
community building activities and experience the city of Boulder,
Colorado.

This workshop will be hosted at "JILA":"https://jila.colorado.edu/about/about-jila", a joint institute between the "University of Colorado, Boulder":"https://www.colorado.edu/" and "NIST":"https://www.nist.gov/".


===== Background =====

Quantitative methods in Physics Education Research has been used to
make strong arguments for instructional and curricula change,
examining differences in student populations, assessing student
attitudes towards physics in different contexts, and recommending
other large scale reforms. This work includes not only using
statistical methods that are commonly used in social science but also
inventing new metrics like normalized gain (Hake, 1998) or visualizing
longitudinal patterns in educational data (Bendinelli and Marder,
2012). Papers in PER that use regression modeling typically explore
data only via logistic or linear regressions and do not use cox style
regressions or modern machine learning models (with few exceptions,
e.g. Young et al., 2019).

Recent efforts in PER have pushed the envelope of quantitative
methods, theory, and data available to PER scientists. Last year,
Physical Review: Physics Education Research published a focused
collection titled "Quantitative Methods in PER: A Critical
Examination" (Knaub, Aiken, Caballero, 2019). This collection examined
topics such as handling network data(Dou and Zwolak, 2019), new item
response theory methods (Zabriskie and Stewart, 2019; Planinic, 2019),
and dealing with missing data (Nissen, Donatello, Van Dusen,
2019). PER has begun collecting large scale data sets that include
registrar data (Aiken, Henderson, Caballero, 2019), attitudinal
surveys (Wilcox et al., 2016), and concept inventory data (Nissen et
al., 2018).

Much of recent literature across social science and statistics has
called for a large change in the types of models used to predict
social systems, the theory and frameworks that motivates the choice of
models, and the evaluation methods used to demonstrate
prediction. Hoffman, Sharma, and Watts (2017) recommends that "current
practices for evaluating predictions must be better standardized",
arguing that current methods in social science focus too much on
explanation and too little on prediction. Hoffman, Sharma, and Watts
(2017) recognizes that there is a fear that complex models may lose
interpretability but points to many innovations in recent literature
that overcome a loss of interpretability in complex
models. Historically this conversation has been going on in statistics
for many years. Breiman (2001) identified two separate cultures that
use statistical models: one culture is grounded in the theory that
data are generated from stochastic models, the other culture is
grounded in the theory that the model that generates the data is
unknown.  Breiman (2001) argues that by assuming that data is
generated from stochastic models, and thus only linear models such as
ordinary least squares regression or multi-level regressions can be
used, researchers artificially restrict themselves from a wide variety
of models that may produce better understanding of the data.
